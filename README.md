# A Functional Library for Python
A few functions that I have created based on frameworks like RamdaJS and Lodash.

The functions are mostly curried and where fitting, e.g. find, find_all I have implemented lodash's iteratee as a predicate option.

So far the list includes

## Props
get_prop,
prop_equals

## Path
get_by_path,
set_by_path,
path_equals

## Find
find,
find_all

## Flatten
flat,
flatMap

## Reduce
reduce,
reduce_right

## Compose
compose_two,
compose_three,
compose,
pipe

## Curry
curry

## Memoize
memoize
